Brief Explanation of High Availability Architecture & Traffic Flow

For Task 3, the application architecture was upgraded to a highly available setup by
introducing an Internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) & an Auto Scaling 
Group (ASG). The EC2 instances were moved to private subnets for better security, 
ensuring they are not directly reachable from the internet. A Launch Template was 
created to define the instance configuration, and the ASG uses this template to 
automatically launch EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.

The ALB placed in public subnets receives all incoming requests from the internet. 
It forwards traffic to a Target Group, which routes the requests to EC2 instances 
running in private subnets. If any instance becomes unhealthy or fails, the ALB 
automatically stops sending traffic to it, and the ASG replaces it with a new instance.
This setup ensures continuous availability, fault tolerance, and automatic scaling based on demand.

Traffic Flow:
Internet → ALB (public subnets) → Target Group → EC2 instances (private subnets).
