a) Why cost monitoring is important for beginners

For me as a beginner, cost monitoring is important because I’m still learning how AWS pricing works, 
and it’s very easy to leave something running without realising it. A small mistake like keeping an
EC2 instance or NAT Gateway active can unexpectedly increase the bill. By setting up alerts, I can 
keep track of my usage and make sure I don’t cross the Free Tier limits. It also gives me confidence 
that I’m in control of my spending while practising and experimenting with AWS services.

b) What causes sudden increases in AWS bills

From my experience, AWS bills usually increase suddenly when resources run in the background without
us noticing. Things like EC2 instances, EBS volumes, NAT Gateways, or data transfer can silently
increase costs if they are not stopped. Misconfigurations or accidentally deploying resources in
multiple Availability Zones can also lead to higher charges. Basically, whenever something keeps
running for a long time or scales unexpectedly, the bill can shoot up.
